# Punct

Punct is a programming environment for publishing things, implemented in Racket. It uses inline
Racket code to extend CommonMark-flavored Markdown, which is parsed into a format-independent AST
that can be rendered in HTML (or any other target file type).

**Documentation is at <https://joeldueck.com/what-about/prose/>**.
